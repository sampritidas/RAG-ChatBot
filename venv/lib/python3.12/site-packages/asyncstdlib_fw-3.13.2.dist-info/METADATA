The ``asyncstdlib`` library re-implements functions and classes of the Python
standard library to make them compatible with ``async`` callables, iterables
and context managers.
It is fully agnostic to ``async`` event loops and seamlessly works with
``asyncio``, third-party libraries such as ``trio``, as well as
any custom ``async`` event loop.

* Full set of ``async`` versions of advantageous standard library helpers,
  such as ``zip``, ``map``, ``enumerate``, ``functools.reduce``,
  ``itertools.tee``, ``itertools.groupby`` and many others.
* Safe handling of ``async`` iterators to ensure prompt cleanup, as well as
  various helpers to simplify safely using custom ``async`` iterators.
* Small but powerful toolset to seamlessly integrate existing sync code
  into ``async`` programs and libraries.

Check out the `documentation`_ to get started or take a look around.
